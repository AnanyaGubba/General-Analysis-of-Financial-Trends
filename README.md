# General-Analysis-of-Financial-Trends
This project performs an end-to-end financial data analysis and prediction, combining the power of machine learning, data visualization, and business reporting. The goal is to identify key trends in financial metrics such as revenue, expenses, profits, and customer growth, and to build predictive models that assist in strategic decision-making.

In addition to Python-based analytics and forecasting, this project integrates:

 - Interactive dashboards built using Power BI

 - A summary report delivered as a PowerPoint presentation

# 🛠️ 2. Tech Stack Used
🔷 Programming & ML
- Python

  - pandas, numpy – data handling

  - scikit-learn – model training and evaluation

  - matplotlib, seaborn – visualizations

📊 Visualization
- Power BI

  - Interactive dashboards for KPI tracking and comparative trend analysis

📄 Reporting
- Microsoft PowerPoint

  - Business summary and key takeaways from the analysis

# ✨ 3. Features
- Data Exploration & Cleaning

  - Missing value handling, outlier treatment, and normalization

  - Descriptive statistics and visual trend analysis

- Predictive Modeling

  - Trains supervised learning models (e.g., regression models) for future financial prediction

  - Evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

- Power BI Dashboard

  - Dynamic visuals: line charts, bar graphs, slicers, and trend comparison tools

  - Drill-down and filter capabilities by region, category, and time period

- Executive Report (PPT)

  - Summarizes problem statement, key findings, methodology, and actionable insights
 
# ⚙️ 4. How It Works
🔁 Workflow
1. Data Ingestion
Load structured financial data from CSV or Excel.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  - Understand trends and distributions using plots and summary statistics

  - Identify correlations between key metrics

3. Data Preprocessing

  - Convert date formats

  - Encode categorical values

  - Normalize/scale numerical features

4. Model Training

  - Apply regression or classification models

  - Evaluate using test/train split and performance metrics

5. Power BI Integration

 - Import cleaned dataset into Power BI

  - Build interactive dashboards for real-time data slicing and storytelling

6. PowerPoint Report

  - Compile insights, visuals, and business recommendations into a well-structured presentation
